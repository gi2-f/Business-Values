TOE Business Values 
Value No. 1. - Ideation 
Ideas can come from anywhere. 
Ideas can be Top-Down. 
Ideas do not have to come from the subject matter expert. 
Ideas can come from anyone in the organisation regardless of hierarchy. 
Ideas can come from your customers. 
Ideas can come from outside your industry. 
Ideas solve market need. 
Ensure you make your idea a reality. 
 
Things to do while seeking for ideas. 
1. Review emails thoroughly for ideas. Great ideas can come from anyone. 
2. Internal meetings - listen carefully to what others are saying at a meeting 
3. Take a look at what is happening in the rest of the world, inevitably it will happen in your local market. 
 
"Everyone dreams. It's the easiest thing to do, but what is important is not the ability to dream, but how you translate that dream into action and reality. That energy and discipline that you apply to translate a dream, an idea, a vision to reality is the defining force. 
Nobody will reward you for having great ideas, but you will be rewarded for having outcomes and what you have achieved." Tony O. Elumelu CON 
 
"With every societal challenge comes a business opportunity."  
 
Example of the ideation concept being applied: 
1. UBA'S TV station - RED TV came from a subject matter expert. 
2. STB which was a banking business hired staff from Mr Biggs (A fast food chain), Hotels and airlines. 
Why did they do this ? 
The idea was to find out how others in the service industry handle customer relationship. 
3. T. Oge Elumelu - TOE's first child/daughter, in her first ever presentation at the Heirs Holdings (February 17, 2017), came up with a brilliant idea for TEF and UBA. 
One of the ideas she came up with was inspired by a T Mobile advert where a celebrity - Justin Bieber - had been used in the adverts resulting in a huge growth in online views for T Mobile. 
 
 Creativity 
"Understand the dynamics, the distinguishing and competitive factors of the industry you play in and how to disrupt the market." 
Disruptive innovation is about creating new markets and discovering new categories of customers. 
Creativity is the generation of ideas that are  
* Novel 
* Useful 
* Appropriate 
 
Examples of creativity applied in Business. 
1. STB went into all the state capitals when no new generation bank was there yet. So they had the first mover advantage. 
2. STB permitted customers to open accounts with zero balance. Financial services were therefore available to the unbanked - financial inclusion. 
This was replicated across 19 other African countries. 
At the moment, UBA opens about 500,000 customer accounts every month, and now has over 30million customers, over 630 branches and customer touch points, over 2600 ATMs, over 148,000 POS, robust online and mobile banking platforms and social media. 
 
A quote from someone in the Newspapers about Business Disruption. 
"Actually, when you think of disruption, you think of technology, in Nigeria, think of the banking industry, how............. disrupted their industry that changed the face of the banking industry, and the way we bank in the country. Tony Elumelu who parented Standard Trust Bank (STB) that later acquired United Bank of Africa (UBA) is another example. It was STB that first opened savings accounts for students with no initial deposit. The bank attracted large base of customers, mostly young people. I remember how NYSC members flooded STB located on Oba Akran Avenue in Ikeja, Lagos to open accounts back in the days." 
 
Food for Thought 
"The rare type of leaders are those that have the ability to Think and Do.  
Ensure your idea is not obsolete before you implement it. 
Think - Do ! 
Think - Execute ! 
Think - Accomplish in a timely manner!" - Tony O.  Elumelu. CON
